# Two-line-Element-Set-Ontology (TLE-O)
An ontology for the TLE. An ontological formalization of the TLE data format.

## Scope
The ontology is about the TLEs as understood in the space community (i.e., space situational awareness, space domain awareness, astrodynamics, astronautics). It provides constructs for the key words, components and content of the TLEs.
## Purpose
* To support space situational/domain awareness, space sustainability and space safety
* To facilitate data-sharing, interoperability and data search and retrieval, where desired
* To innovate by exploring ontological applications to the space domain

## Status
- In-progresss (pending formal support to develop). Subject to revision. No claims to completeness.
- Funding/sponsors, work collaborations or a PhD study opportunity are needed to continue, sustain and complete development. Contact the author with offers and interest.
